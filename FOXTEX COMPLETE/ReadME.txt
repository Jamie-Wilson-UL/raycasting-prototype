GZDOOM: If you've already worked with GZDOOM you probably know what files are what here:
- GZdoom scripts: all the text files that let GZDOOM and UDB identify the textures
- Brightmaps: Masks generated to simulate full brightness in GZDOOM, can also be used as emission maps.
- Patches: Files used to create extra textures using the TEXTURES scripts
- Textures: Where all the image files are located
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Developer: If you're not working with GZDoom and just want to use these textures for your game or project or else, then your focus should go to the Textures, Brightmaps and Patches folders...
- Brightmaps: Here are located textures used to mask out the areas with emission/fullbrightness
- Patches: Here we have some size-sheets for easier use
- Textures: The common 512px or lower textures are located
